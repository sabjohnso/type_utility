#+TITLE: Type Utilitiy

* Status
  Not suitable for prodution use or otherwise. Very early development prototype code.

* Overview
  Tools for working with types in modern C++

* Known issues
** C++23, GCC and Catch2 v3.40
The Catch2 testing framework does not compile with gcc 12 or 13  using
cxx_std_23. As a work-around configure with C++20.  This is an issue
between GCC and Catch2 and does not reflect problems with this library.

As a work-around configure with C++ 20 instead of C++ 23
